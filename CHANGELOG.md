# 1.8.0 — Astral

- An exclusive black-and-white Astral interface, with optional screen and hover transitions and a bounded meteor animation.
- Continuous video on multiplayer server selection as well as the title screen, including removal of the legacy opaque server-list background while video is active.
- Optional Atlas Client 3.0.3 integration for both custom ImGui and vanilla menus, without modifying or bundling Atlas.
- Astral interface with dark panels, black/white accents, keyboard focus and live preview.
- Minecraft language integration: Turkish and English, with English fallback for other languages.
- Responsive video library, refresh, playback status and an on/off switch.
- Full resolution by default for new configurations; existing quality settings are preserved.
- Lanczos scaling, fill/fit framing and a bounded 4K decode size.
- FPS conversion now preserves playback speed; changing darkening, framing or vignette does not restart the decoder.
- Immutable frame handoff and session checks prevent torn frames and stale frames after changing videos.
- Asynchronous video probing, timeout and process cleanup keep the menu responsive.
- Validate corrupted config values and save configuration atomically.
- Both `videos` and existing `videolar` folders are scanned; invalid paths and directories disguised as videos are ignored.
- Separate builds target Minecraft 1.20.1 (Java 17+) and 1.21.11 (Java 21+). Other versions are not declared compatible without validation.
